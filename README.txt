<h4>Description</h4>

[Official website:](http://www.itechflare.com)
This is a free contemporary multi-purpose responsive plugin with very easy control and display flow that gives website owners the capability to professionally & elegantly promote & represent their long job achievements in a unified good looking portfolio grid; yet you can use it as flixable gallary plugin.

First, all you have to do is adding as much portfolio posts as you want in the new dashboard admin menu "Portfolio" along with giving a good looking featured image to each post, so it can be presented inside the portfolio grid as per your taste.

For placing your portfolio grid anywhere in your website, just use the following shortcode and you are done:
<pre>
Template:
[ waving {height="xxx" or width="xxx"} theme="[light|dark]" all="[false|true]" 
	showCat="[true|false]" tag="[string]" clicking="[false|true]" /]
</pre>
<pre>
Example: 
[waving width="200" theme="light" all="0" showCat="true" 
	tag="[city-center or City Center or cITY Center]" /]
	
Notice that if you remove width attribute, and use height, the whole images will be resized based on height instead of width.
</pre>
<h3>
Attribute Definitions:
</h3>
* **width** attribute: Is controlling each portfolio item's width for the whole grid elements, by default it will be set to 0. Notice that you don't need to write "px" after numbers.

* **height** attribute: Is controlling each portfolio item's height for the whole grid elements, by default it will be set to 250px. Notice that you don't need to write "px" after numbers. If you set both width and height attributes the width attribute will take-over, so please make sure to remove width attribute if you need your portfolio elements to be sorted based on height.

* **theme** attribute: With this you can define your theme to be either light or dark.

* **all** attribute: With this attribute you can disable "all" category from showing-up in Portfolio Category menu.

* **showCat**: With showCat attribute you can choose whether you want to show the category selection menu or not (NEW)

* **tag**: Yes Finally! With this attribute you can select only those portfolio that you have tagged with specific tag name to be shown. And it does accept case insensitive strings as shown above in the example line(NEW)

* **clicking**: This attribute allows the admin to disable the clicking effect for portfolio items(NEW)

In the portfolio post section you can attach only one custom gallary that can consist of infinite number of images using the native wordpress media window, and once you add the shortcode of the gallary, make sure to place it inside a hidden div so it doesn't show inside the portfolio content as follow:
<pre>
&lt;div style="display: none;"&gt;
	[gallery ids="41,42,43,44,45"]
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
